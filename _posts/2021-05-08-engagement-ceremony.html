<p>In May of 2021, Ali surprised Seth at the train station, and Seth surprised Ali by asking her if she would like to get "fake married." They compromised with an engagement ceremony, carefully thrown together in one weeks' time so that they could include Ali's dad as his health was declining. It was held on May 8 in the Higgins backyard and Seth's parents, Jim and Cindy, dropped everything on short notice to fly in from Pennsylvania and attend. Ali's best friend Maggie officiated, her mom Kathy Les provided the flowers, and her partner Franz did the videography, music, and cake pick-up. Both of our dads spoke during the ceremony, which can be viewed by clicking below.
