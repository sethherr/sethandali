<p class="pt-3">That time we made a plan and then everything went according to it. Just kidding!</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Our birth story</h2>

---

We welcomed 2024 with our new babe in our armsâ€“Cedar Thomas Herr Higgins was born on December 22, 2023 in San Francisco. Jim and Cindy, Seth's parents, and Glenda, Ali's mom, joined us for Cedar's early days as we celebrated Cedar's first Christmas. We have been joyously overwhelmed by the support of our community in the first month of Cedar's life. Thank you to everyone who has sent us gifts, brought us dinner, or kept us in their thoughts as we adjust to life as new parents. 

Ali was pregnant for 41 and a half weeks of 2023 so our adventures were a little more tame than years past. We were happy to make it to friends' weddings all across the world and enjoyed great trips to Canada and Germany. We drank moose milk in Edmonton, swam in Munich, rode bikes in Berlin and connected with old friends all over. We celebrated our upcoming family addition with two baby showers, a joint housewarming with Glenda and a Halloween-themed shower in San Francisco where Ali was Pregnant Beyonce and Seth was a leather daddy. 

We are sending you love in 2024 and we can't wait for you to meet Cedar!
