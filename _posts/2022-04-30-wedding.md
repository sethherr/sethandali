We got married on April 30th, 2022 in Fort Bragg, CA. It was an amazing day made possible by our incredible friends and family, and we are forever thankful to everyone who supported us leading up to the event.

If you have stories (we have loved hearing many so far!) or photos to share, feel free to email them to us at email@sethandali.com or add them to our google photo album: [Google photo album of photos from our friends](#)

If you weren't able to attend or if you want to re-experience our magical (but very short!) ceremony, you can watch it here. (LINK)

The program from our wedding is here.

And finally, we are excited to share the professional photos from our wedding!
