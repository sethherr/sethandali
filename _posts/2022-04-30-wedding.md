We got married on April 30th, 2022 in Fort Bragg, CA.

Here are [the photo highlights from our wedding](https://photos.app.goo.gl/bCEDeTv82DSDkhtv6)!

It was an amazing day made possible by our incredible friends and family, and we are forever thankful to everyone who supported us leading up to the event.

If you weren't able to attend or if you want to re-experience our magical (but very short!) ceremony, you can [watch it here]( "https://youtu.be/jEm-dyVP3v8").

If you have stories (we have loved hearing many so far!) or photos to share, feel free to email them to us at email@sethandali.com or add them to our [Google photo album of photos from our friends](https://photos.app.goo.gl/De8KQz3VGNY2uPpZ6).

You can find the professional wedding photos on [our photographerâ€™s website](https://laurenlindleyphotography.pixieset.com/aliseth/) - the password is `likemostlylegal`.

_p.s. We find ourselves wishing we could relive so many of the moments from the weekend._

_Walking down the aisle and feeling completely overwhelmed with love for our friends and family and for each other. Feeling so thankful to have incredibly talented friends who made our bicycle arch dreams come true!_

_Enjoying the first notes of All You Need is Love sung by Maura and Maren._

_Navigating the rocky beach to take pictures during sunset while you all cheered from the bluff._

_Watching dogs and babies frolic and pounce and blow bubbles during golden hour._

_Laughing and crying through the incredible toasts by Glenda via Steve, Cindy, Maggie, Jeff, Allie, and Mason._

_Letting loose on the dance floor while longtime friend and honorary family member John Pistotti played the best beats._

_And of course every single hug, every smile, every teary greeting, story, and note of love!_
