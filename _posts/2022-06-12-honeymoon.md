We'd been planning on bikepacking (AKA mountain bike touring) across Switzerland - but Seth broke his wrist mountain biking in Oakland a few weeks before our trip, so we had to change plans.

It turned out to be great! We had an amazing time taking trains and buses around Switzerland and hiking on things we couldn't have biked on.

Ali has wanted to stay and hike between [Swiss mountain huts](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/summer-autumn/hiking/alpine-passes-trail/sac-huetten/) -  the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) maintains huts in the mountains that provide breakfast and dinner and sleeping pads, all you have to do is bring a sleeping bag liner (or a sheet). It turns out that we were pretty early season and most of the huts that were _really_ high up in the mountains were still closed, but we still found some - and it was amazing.
